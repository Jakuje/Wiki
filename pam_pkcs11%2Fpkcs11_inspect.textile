NAME
       pkcs11_inspect - print certificate contents

SYNOPSIS
       pkcs11_inspect [debug] [config_file=<filename>]

DESCRIPTION
       pkcs11_inspect  uses  the  pam_pkcs11 library infrastructure to get the
       content of a certificate and display it.

       pkcs11_inspect uses the same  configuration  file  and  arguments  than
       pam_pkcs11(8) PAM module. It loads defined mapper modules, and use them
       to look into the certificate for required entries (ie: ms_mapper  looks
       for ms UPN entries, and so on).

       When  a  mapper module finds a proper entry in the certificate, it con‐
       verts to UTF-8 and print it to stdout.

OPTIONS
       debug  Enable debugging output.

       config_file=<filename>
              Sets  the  configuration  file  to   use.   Default   value   is
              /etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf.

       As  it  uses  the same configuration file as pam_pkcs11, all pam_pkcs11
       options are also available. Note that some of them have no sense  in  a
       non-PAM environment, so they will be ignored. Some mapper options (map‐
       file, ignorecase) have no effect on certificate contents, so they  will
       be ignored too.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success  pkcs11_inspect  prints  on stdout all certificate contents
       that are found for mappers and returns 0.

       On error it returns 1.

FILES
       /etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf

EXAMPLES
       To run this program the standard way, insert a smart card in the reader
       and type:
