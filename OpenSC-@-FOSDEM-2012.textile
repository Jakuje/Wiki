("mailing list post":https://lists.fosdem.org/pipermail/security-devroom/2011-November/000084.html)
 * E (45m) Benedikt Heintel, CACert .org "Trust - the root of evil?!"
  ** Abstract: "In a highly connected world like ours is trust one of the most important assets. But what if the root to trust is not trustworthy?

 2011 was the year where one Certificate Authority (CA) after the other
 came to fall. The cases of the Dutch DigiNotar and the Malaysian 
 DigiCert are the best know. The system of commercial CAs depends on a
 wrong understanding of liability and trust. CAcert's web of trust
 tries to overcomes the liability issues by trusting a group of trusted
 people wherein each individual is liable for its own action.

 This talk enlightens why most commercial CAs are not trustworthy by
 default, what we can learn from 2011's cases, what makes CAcert
 different, why CAcert is not in the browsers by default and what we do
 to make it happen."

 * F (45m) Embedded/GPU crypto, yaSSL
  ** yaSSL made some great progress in the past year with the CyaSSL embedded SSL library.  As such, this talk will provide an overview of technical and community progress in the last year and news on the current state of yaSSL.  Details on what's new will include the addition of new cipher suites and cipher modes, better portability, new ports to software projects and operating systems, and community involvement.
