h1. Belgian Belpic

Belgium has released an "official software":http://www.belgium.be/zip/eid_datacapture_fr.html for their eID card.
That software is a modified version of OpenSC. The source code for this software has been "published":http://www.belgium.be/zip/middleware_source_code_fr.html as well.

OpenSC 0.10.* will include support for the Belgian eID card, except for legally binding signatures (with the so-called Signature key) as this requires a GUI, which is not yet available/implemented.
Till that new release please use the "belpic" software available from the belgian state.

Thanks to Zetes for their support of OpenSC
