h1. XML Advanced Electronic Signatures (XAdES)

<b>Moved to [[Application Support|Using-smart-cards-with-applications]] </b>

XML Advanced Electronic Signatures are defined in the ETSI standard "ETSI TS 101 903 V1.1.1":http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.1.1/.

"OpenXAdES":http://www.openxades.org/ implements that standard in a library, and 
"GNU DigiDoc":http://sourceforge.net/projects/gdigidoc a graphical user interface application built on top the libdigidoc (AKA OpenXAdES).

libdigidoc uses PKCS#11 for smartcard access on non-windows platforms and works well with OpenSC.
