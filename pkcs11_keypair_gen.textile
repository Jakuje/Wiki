<b>PKCS11 Keypair generation, certificate request and writing the requested cert to the card</b>

You can use the the pkcs11 library (<i>opensc-pkcs11.so</i> or <i>opensc-pkcs11.dll</i>) with Mozilla/Firefox/Netscape to go to an on-line CA (Certificate Authority). In this case, the browser will:
 * ask the pkcs11 lib to generate a keypair on your card,
 * create a certificate request,
 * ask the pkcs11 lib to sign the cert request,
 * send the cert request to the CA,
 * (at a later time, when the CA is done) download the requested cert,
 * and ask the pkcs11 lib to store the cert on your card.

However in order to work:
 * you have to format your card with the "onepin" profile option:
    *  <i>pkcs15-init -E</i>
    *  <i>pkcs15-init -C -p pkcs15+onepin --pin xxxx --puk yyyy</i>
 * you have set <i>cache_pins</i> should to <i>true</i> in <i>opensc.conf</i>

Currently, only 1 certificate can be requested this way. The reason is that Mozilla changes the ID of the key and cert into a hash of 20 bytes, and this confuses our pkcs15init library (used to 1-byte IDs) who will attempt to create a new key on the place of the first key (which fails)...
