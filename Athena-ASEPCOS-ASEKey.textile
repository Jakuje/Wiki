h1. Athena ASEPCOS / ASEKey

"Athena":http://www.athena-scs.com "ASEPCOS smartcards":http://www.athena-scs.com/product.asp?pid=22 and tokens are supported from OpenSC-0.11.6.
 * ATR: "3B D6 18 00 81 B1 80 7D 1F 03 80 51 00 61 10 30 8F":http://smartcard-atr.appspot.com/parse?ATR=3BD6180081B1807D1F038051006110308F

Full PKCS#15 emulation is supported.

Athena cooperates with the OpenSC project and provides any required information.

If you are interested in Athena's tokens (ASEKey), make sure you order the CCID compliant version.

Another issue you may encouter is failure to initialize the PKCS#15 structure. This may be due to pre-formated smartcard using Athena proprietary provider. If you have this issue, ask for help in OpenSC MailingList.

Athena also makes [[JavaCards|JavaCards]], which require a supported applet.
