h1. Crazy ideas related to OpenSC, PKCS#11 and crypto in general

The usefulness of the following ideas might be questionable, but implementing something from this list would probably earn instant kudos.
 * A scriptable PKCS#11 module with Python, maybe based on "elmer":http://elmer.sourceforge.net/
 * A JavaCard applet implementing a shared secret based RSA key, requiring M out of N cards to be present for operations, together with a PKCS#11 or JCE provider to integrate into existing apps like EJBCA.
