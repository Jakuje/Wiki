h1. Serbian EID

For the serbian EID there has been various software components provided by the Ministry of Internal Affairs at "http://ca.mup.gov.rs/download-lat.html":http://ca.mup.gov.rs/download-lat.html

Unfortunately (of course) these components are only available for Windows OS. 

The EID is based on ApolloOS 2.43. OpenSC does not suppor this card by default, thus i've started to implement a driver for this card.
The patches are available at the for of the official OpenSC repository at my github account: "https://github.com/vigsterkr/OpenSC":https://github.com/vigsterkr/OpenSC

Currently it supports:
  * reading EF from the card
  * reading the card's serial number
  * extract ID information (e.g. name, address, issue date etc.) from the card with 'eidenv' tool

TODO:
  * debug and add PIN verification/changin method
  * debug and add _PKCS#15_ support

Kudos to Goran Rakic who has done the initial debugging of this card. See his python based implementation at "http://gitorious.org/freesteel/pyfreesteel":http://gitorious.org/freesteel/pyfreesteel
