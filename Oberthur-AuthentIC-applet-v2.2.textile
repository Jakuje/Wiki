h1. Oberthur AuthentIC applet v2.2

The _"oberthur"_ driver supports Oberthur 64k JavaCards in the Versions v4/2.1.1, v5 and v5/2.2.0 and CosmopolIC v5.2/2.2,
that contains applet AuthentIC v2.2.

The driver was written by Viktor Tarasov of OpenTrust. Thanks for donating this driver!

The last fully tested driver is included into OpenSC-0.9.6 . 

The driver implements pkcs15 and pkcs15init emulation. It means that the OpenSC support is compatible with the native Oberthur's middleware: the cards initialized in one middleware will be recognized by another; the crypto objects created in one middleware will be usable in another.


h2. Oberthur applet AuthentIC v3.1

Oberthur's card on the _"CosmopolIC v7"_ platform with applet _"AuthentIC v3.1"_ is supported in the [[IAS/ECC branch|IAS-ECC]] of OpenSC. 
For this card IAS/ECC branch implements the GlobalPlatform secure messaging (SPC01).


h2. Oberthur Cosmo JavaCards

Oberthur also provides generic blank JavaCard-s that work with a supported open source applet.
