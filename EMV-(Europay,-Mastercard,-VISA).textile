OpenSC does <b>not</b> support EMV cards!

OpenSC versions before v0.12 included a dummy EMV driver. EMV cards (bank cards with a chip) are usually not capable of doing crypto operations, unless they have support for DDA (Dynamic Data Authentication). Not many cards, even if issued recently, support DDA.

Also note that the EMV "Chip and PIN" is broken: "http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/banking/nopin/oakland10chipbroken.pdf":http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/banking/nopin/oakland10chipbroken.pdf
