I'm a system administrator and Free Software enthusiast from Belgrade, Serbia. I've been working with Free Software for the past 7 years (both professionally and as an amateur) with also some preceding hobby period. I enjoy integrating different components together, and I'm currently entangled in learning as much about PKI as possible. I also enjoy writing nice documentation. You can find a bit more about me "here":http://majic.rs/.
