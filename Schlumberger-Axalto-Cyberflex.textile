h1. Schlumberger / Axalto Cyberflex

Earlier versions of Cyberflex cards have the same or a very similiar filesystem interface like the Cryptoflex cards.
Those cards work well with OpenSC.

Newer versions however are pure JavaCards and will not work without a JavaApplet.

"MuscleCard":http://www.musclecard.com/ is an open source software containing a Java Cardlet for several smart cards
implementing the JavaCard standard. Starting with OpenSC 0.11.2 support for MuscleCard has been added. 

Current Test Status: Only for the brave! This might kill your card! No warranty whatsoever! But initialization with OpenSC works.

h2. Reader configuration

If you have an e-gate token, you need to "configure it for PC/SC":wiki/Using-Schlumberger-e-gate-on-Linux properly, as the tools used for loading the applet into the card only speak PC/SC. 

h2. Installing GlobalPlatform tools

First you need to install gpshell from the "GlobalPlatform open source project":http://sourceforge.net/projects/globalplatform/:

<pre><code>wget http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/globalplatform/globalplatform-5.0.0.tar.gz
tar xfvz globalplatform-5.0.0.tar.gz
cd globalplatform-5.0.0
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install
cd ..

wget http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/globalplatform/gpshell-1.4.0.tar.gz
tar xfvz gpshell-1.4.0.tar.gz
cd gpshell-1.4.0
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install
cd ..
</code></pre>

Note: gpshell 1.4.1 and later <b>do not</b> work with these instructions and give an error:
<pre><code>install -file CardEdgeII.ijc -nvDataLimit 12000 -instParam 00 -priv 2
Command --> 80E602001B05A00000000107A0000000030000000AEF08C6023100C8022EE00000
Wrapped command --> 84E602002305A00000000107A0000000030000000AEF08C6023100C8022EE0002C197064B44B6AC700
Response <-- 6A80
install_for_load() returns 0x80206A80 (6A80: Wrong data / Incorrect values in command data.)
</code></pre>
Bug @ sf.net: "https://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?func=detail&aid=2406176&group_id=143343&atid=755201":https://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?func=detail&aid=2406176&group_id=143343&atid=755201

h2. Loading MuscleCard Applet

The Muscle Web page is at "http://www.musclecard.com/":http://www.musclecard.com/ but you can download the Applet directly from "http://www.identityalliance.com/CardEdgeII.ijc.":http://www.identityalliance.com/CardEdgeII.ijc. A recent copy is also attached to this wiki attachment:CardEdgeII.ijc

You need to run gpshell with these commands:
<pre><code>$ gpshell
mode_201
enable_trace
establish_context
card_connect -readerNumber 1 // Depends on your reader
select -AID a0000000030000
open_sc -security 1 -keyind 0 -keyver 0 -mac_key 404142434445464748494a4b4c4d4e4f -enc_key 404142434445464748494a4b4c4d4e4f // Open secure channel
delete -AID A0000003230101
delete -AID A00000032301
delete -AID A00000000101
delete -AID A000000001
install -file CardEdgeII.ijc -nvDataLimit 12000 -instParam 00 -priv 2
card_disconnect
release_context
</code></pre>

Note:  On the Cyberflex 64k, you need to use the following:
<pre><code>mode_201
enable_trace
establish_context
card_connect
select -AID a000000003000000
open_sc -security 1 -keyind 0 -keyver 0 -mac_key 404142434445464748494a4b4c4d4e4f -enc_key 404142434445464748494a4b4c4d4e4f 
delete -AID A0000003230101
delete -AID A00000032301
delete -AID A00000000101
delete -AID A000000001
install_for_load -pkgAID A000000001 -nvCodeLimit 13500 -sdAID A000000003000000
load -file CardEdgeCflex.ijc
install_for_install -instParam 00 -priv 02 -AID A00000000101 -pkgAID A000000001 -instAID A00000000101 -nvDataLimit 12000
card_disconnect
release_context
</code></pre>


The last two "delete" commands will remove an older version of the applet.

Next you need to set the PIN codes to "00000000", so you can initialize the card.

<pre><code>opensc-tool -s 00:A4:04:00:06:A0:00:00:00:01:01  -s B0:2A:00:00:38:08:4D:75:73:63:6C:65:30:30:04:01:08:30:30:30:30:30:30:30:30:08:30:30:30:30:30:30:30:30:05:02:08:30:30:30:30:30:30:30:30:08:30:30:30:30:30:30:30:30:00:00:17:70:00:02:01
</code></pre>

Now the token has a working MuscleCard Applet and is ready for use with OpenSC.

h2. Using the Token with OpenSC
<pre><code>pkcs15-init -EC -p pkcs15+onepin
</code></pre>

If you're asked for "Unspecified PIN [reference 1] required", use "00000000".

<pre><code>$ pkcs15-init -EC -p pkcs15+onepin --pin 1234 --puk 12345678
Using reader with a card: Eutron SIM Pocket Combo 01 00
Unspecified PIN [reference 1] required.

h1. FAQ

h3. What to do on Windows ?

"http://sourceforge.net/projects/globalplatform":http://sourceforge.net/projects/globalplatform has a download package of GPShell.exe for windows, so no need to compile it on your own.

Download
 * "http://mesh.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/globalplatform/GPShell-1.3.1.zip":http://mesh.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/globalplatform/GPShell-1.3.1.zip
 * "http://www.identityalliance.com/CardEdgeII.ijc":http://www.identityalliance.com/CardEdgeII.ijc
and unzip both in the current directory. Run the same commands mentioned above and you should be fine. Note however that this is 100% untested,
please report back if it works (or not) on the opensc-user or opensc-devel MailingLists. Thanks for your feedback!

h3. Is there a tool for it?

A small tool to get some information about the cards can be found here: "http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~cg2v/jcop-opensc-0.2.tar.gz":http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~cg2v/jcop-opensc-0.2.tar.gz
It was written for IBM JCop cards but should work as well with Cyberflex cards. Note: Does not work with latest OpenSC as sc_check_sw symbol is not exported from libopensc.

h3. How can I format or update cards with the old applet?

If you use ID Ally - it will delete the old applet before installation of the new.  gpshell should allow you to delete:
first A00000000101
then A000000001

h3. What can I do if I specified a too small size?

Delete A00000000101 (instance) and reinstantiate to a larger size.
(this will delete all data / key / ... )

h3. I'm asked about Unspecified PIN [Reference 1]

There are two APDUs that have to be run first if you use GPShell (which sets the default pins, puks, etc):

_00 A4 04 00 06 A0 00 00 00 01 01_ and
_B0 2A 00 00 38 08 4D 75 73 63 6C 65 30 30 04 01 08 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 08 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 05 02 08 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 08 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 00 00 17 70 00 02 01_

Both need to be send in one go - without card reset in between. The first selects the muscle applet, the second sets the default pins to "00000000". You can copypaste the above opensc-tool line to execute these commands.
