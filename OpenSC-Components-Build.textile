h2. Binaries

Binaries are available "here":http://www.opensc-project.org/downloads/users/alonbl/build/.

Binaries are at the following format:

<i>opensc-${CHOST}-${BUILD_VERSION}-${COMPONENT}.tar.bz2</i>

 * ${CHOST} is the host on which binary runs.
 * ${BUILD_VERSION} is the version of the build environment.
 * ${COMPONENT}
    * srclist - Sources list.
    * src - Sources used to build.
    * base - OpenSC base components.
    * engine_pkcs11 - engine_pkcs11 overlay.
    * openvpn - OpenVPN overlay.

    The OpenVPN overlay is provided in order to solve OpenSSL version incompatibility between OpenSC and OpenVPN projects.
    The OpenVPN is provided in binary form compiled with the same OpenSSL version as the OpenSC components.

Install components by extracting the base and requested overlays tarballs into one directory.
