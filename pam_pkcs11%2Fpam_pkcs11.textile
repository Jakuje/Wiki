NAME
       pam_pkcs11 - PAM Authentication Module for PKCS#11 token libraries

SYNOPSIS
       pam_pkcs11.so [debug] [configfile=<configfile>]

DESCRIPTION
       This  Linux-PAM  login  module  allows  a  X.509 certificate based user
       login. The certificate  and  its  dedicated  private  key  are  thereby
       accessed  by means of an appropriate PKCS #11 module. For the verifica‐
       tion of the users’ certificates, locally stored CA certificates as well
       as either online or locally accessible CRLs are used.

CONFIGURATION
       The   program  that  needs  a  PAM  service  should  be  configured  in
       /etc/pam.conf or /etc/pam.d/<servicename>.

       pam_pkcs11 can be used in the <auth> PAM chain.

       For details on how to configure PAM services, see the PAM documentation
       for  your system. This manual does not cover PAM configuration details.
       The existing PAM service definitions for  other  applications  on  your
       system  is  also  a  good source for examples on how to configure a PAM
       service.
