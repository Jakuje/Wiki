h1. pam_p11 - simple RSA authentication with PKCS#11 modules

Pam_p11 is a plugable authentication module ("PAM":http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/) package for using crpytographic PKCS#11 tokens such as smart cards and usb crypto tokens for local authentication.

Pam_p11 uses [[libp11|libp11-PKCS#11-wrapper-library]] to access any PKCS#11 module but it is primarily developed for and tested with OpenSC PKCS#11.

Pam_p11 implements two authentication modules:
 * pam_p11_openssh authenticates the user against public keys found in OpenSSH _~/.ssh/authorized_keys_ file.
 * pam_p11_opensc authenticates the user against certificates found in _~/.eid/authorized_certificates_. It is compatible with the older opensc "pam_opensc" authentication module (eid mode).

Pam_p11 is very simple, it has no config file, no options other than the PKCS#11 module file, does not know about certificate chains, certificate authorities, revocation lists or OCSP.
Perfect for the small installation with no frills.
