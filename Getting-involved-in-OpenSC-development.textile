h1. Getting involved in OpenSC development

Contributions to OpenSC are welcome! This page explains how to contribute to OpenSC.

h2. Development process

 * OpenSC development is coordinated via [mailto:opensc-devel@opensc-project.org] <b>[[mailing list|Mailing-lists]]</b>. You may also use [irc://irc.freenode.net/opensc #opensc on irc.freenode.net] IRC channel for short questions. Start helping the community and reviewing [report:10 support tickets]. Patches fixing [/newticket new] or [report:1 existing bugs] may be attached to the ticket or sent to the [wiki:MailingLists opensc-devel mailing list].
 * Contribution should comply with coding guidelines. A minimal <b>[[Development Policy|Development-Policy]]</b> exists.
 * To develop OpenSC, you may use github and/or gerrit, with a preference to github.
 * [[DRAFT Howto add/support a new card|Adding-a-new-card-driver]]


h2. github process

"https://github.com":https://github.com is a web-based hosting service for software development projects using the Git revision control system.

NOTICE:  github staging directory is the most active branch. So please use github over gerrit.

 * OpenSC source code is hosted on "https://github.com":https://github.com with two branches: 
  * "master":https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC branch which is the OpenSC stable release.
  * "staging":https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/tree/staging branch which the development branch. 
 * OpenSC master branch is available using:
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC.git
cd OpenSC
./bootstrap 
</code></pre>
 * OpenSC staging branch is availabe using:
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC.git
cd OpenSC
git checkout --track origin/staging
./bootstrap 
</code></pre>
 * Read "commits":https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/commits/staging for latest commits.
 * To start coding, create a "Github":https://github.com account. Creating an account with one project is free. Upload your public ssh keys.
 * Visit "OpenSC Github project":https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC and click on Fork to create your own OpenSC repository. Majors features should have their own branch. Bug fixes should go to the Staging branch. 
 * To propose a commit, make a pull request to the main OpenSC "staging":https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/tree/staging repository. 
 * Advertise your pull request. Pull requests are discussed and applied by github core developers.

h2. gerrit process

Gerrit is a free, web-based collaborative review tool which integrates with Git.

WARNING: Gerrit is currently not synchronised and should not be used until it is reset with a fresh copy from github.

 * Register gerrit on "https://www.opensc-project.org/codereview/.":https://www.opensc-project.org/codereview/.
 * It is highly recommended to subscribe to Email notifications. Go to Settings -> Watched Projects and check all notifications boxes for the OpenSC project.
 * [CodeReview Review] patches and add comments.
 * Fetch git commit log:
<pre><code>scp -p -P 8882 www.opensc-project.org:hooks/commit-msg .git/hooks/ s
</code></pre>
 The hook creates the Change-Id for gerrit, allowing a logical change
 to be tracked across multiple iterations of the actual commit e.g. in
 response to review.
 * Patches get into gerrit (see SourceCode ), people review them, and they eventually checked in to the mainstream code.
 * gerrit includes a voting system. To be applied, a patch needs two votes.

h2. Helper tools

 * To test/debug special hardware (smartcard/token), please open an account on OpenSC development server (information coming soon). The development server offers nearly all supported hardware, so you don't have to buy it. [DeveloperHardware Donation of free hardware] is also possible.
 * The OpenSC staging branch is also available to beta testers as binary packages (information coming soon). Releasing beta software to a large audience is part of the quality process.
 * The OpenSC staging branch is installed daily on test servers and go through a series of automatic regressions tests (information coming soon). Some vendors also offer free hardware for testin purpose.
