h1. Getting involved in OpenSC development

Contributions to OpenSC are welcome! This page explains how to contribute to OpenSC.

h2. Development process

 * OpenSC development is coordinated via the list opensc-devel@lists.sourceforge.net. See [[Mailing lists|Mailing-lists]]. Start helping the community by reviewing "Github issues":https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/issues . Patches fixing new or existing issues may be submitted as "Github Pull Requests":https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/pulls or sent to the [[opensc-devel mailing list|Mailing-lists]].
 * Contribution should comply with coding guidelines. A minimal <b>[[Development Policy|Development-Policy]]</b> exists.
 * [[DRAFT Howto add/support a new card|Adding-a-new-card-driver]]
 * New features needs to be tested. At worst transcript of `pkcs11-tool --test` with your card should be attached to Pull Requests. Even better would be implementation of unit tests systematically testing interoduced code.

h2. Test Tools
 * "Minidriver":https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/issues/426#issuecomment-100978020 


h2. github process

"GitHub":https://github.com is a web-based hosting service for software development projects using the Git revision control system.

 * OpenSC source code is hosted on "GitHub":https://github.com :
 * The "OpenSC master branch":https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC is available using:
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC.git
cd OpenSC
./bootstrap 
</code></pre>
 * Read "latest commits":https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/commits/master.
 * To start coding, create a "Github":https://github.com account. Creating an account with one project is free. Upload your public ssh keys.
 * Visit "OpenSC Github project":https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC and click on Fork to create your own OpenSC repository. Majors features should have their own branch. Bug fixes should go to the Staging branch. 
 * To propose a commit, make a pull request to the main OpenSC "master":https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/tree/master repository. 
 * Advertise your pull request. Pull requests are discussed and applied by github core developers.

h2. Pull Requests

The github pull requests (PR) to "OpenSC/OpenSC":https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/pulls are/can-be checked automatically for building on Ubuntu Windows and OSX. At the moment this feature is installed to help the contributors to reveal the compilation errors on the platforms that they do not used to manage (mostly Windows).

The Travis CI runs basic tests on few emulated cards (PIV, IsoApplet, OpenPGP, GIDS, OsEID) to make sure your changes did not break basic functionality of them. Adding more tests is always welcomed.
