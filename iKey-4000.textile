h1. iKey 4000

The new SafeSign iKey 4000 is not supported by opensc.
To add support someone would need the APDU level documentation
and the time and energy to write a new driver.

APDU level documentation is available if you sign an NDA,
please contact Andreas Kroehnert <andreas.kroehnert _at_ de.safenet-inc.com>
