h2. Project chronology


h3. OpenCT 0.6.20 and OpenSC 0.11.13

	On 2010-02-16 OpenCT 0.6.20 and OpenSC 0.11.13 were released,
        both with small fixes for the Rutoken S driver and other small
	bugfixes.

h3. OpenCT 0.6.19 and Engine_PKCS!#11 0.1.8


	On 2010-01-07 OpenCT 0.6.19 was released with improved udev rules
	to help the transition back from hal to udev. Engine_PKCS#11
	0.1.8 was released with a fix for finding certificates and keys.

h3. OpenSC 0.11.12


	On 2009-12-18 OpenSC 0.11.12 was released with a fix for a 
	regression in OpenSC 0.11.5 and later, that made some cards
	initialized with older versions of OpenSC no longer work
	with newer versions.


h3. OpenSC 0.11.11


	On 2009-10-26 OpenSC 0.11.11 was released with updates for "myeid"
	driver and fixing compile issues with OpenSSL 0.9.7 and 1.0.0.


h3. OpenSC 0.11.10


	On 2009-10-20 OpenSC 0.11.10 was released with a new driver "westcos"
	and support for MyEid cards by Aventra (currently limited to using
	cards initialized with aventras software). Rutoken driver was extended
	to include GOST algorithm support.


h3. Engine_pkcs11 0.1.7, Libp11 0.2.7


	For both libp11 and engine_pkcs11 a patch fixing a small bug
	was posted. Since no other development happends with these
	packages, new releases were created on 2009-10-20 to push the
	bugfixes to the users.


h3. OpenCT 0.6.18


	On 2009-09-25 OpenCT 0.6.18 was released with support for rutoken S,
	fixes for usb on BSD systems and fixes for combining openct with
	pcsc-lite.


h3. OpenSC 0.11.9 and OpenCT 0.6.17


	On 2009-07-29 new versions of OpenSC and OpenCT were released,
	mostly with several smaller bug fixes, but also including updates
	to the piv card driver and support for the rutoken ECP.	


h3. Libp11 0.2.6


	On 2009-07-22 libp11 0.2.6 was released fixing the exports file,
	which prior to this release was missing the symbol for the new
	function included in libp11 0.2.5.


h3. New engine_pkcs11 and libp11 releases


	New release of libp11 with an extra functions (thus increased library
	interface version), and a new version of engine_pkcs11 using it, with
	other small fixes too.


h3. New OpenSC release 0.11.8 with security updates

	On 2009-05-07 RSA keys are not secure if the public
	exponent is 1. It should be at least 3, better 65537
	or higher. OpenSC PKCS#11 always sets it to a proper
	value, but a bug in OpenSC 0.11.7 caused pkcs11-tool
	to ask for public exponent 1 when creating new keys.
	Only the combination of pkcs11-tool from OpenSC 0.11.7
	with a third party PKCS#11 Module and a card ignoring
	this bad value would create such an insecure key.


h3. New OpenCT release 0.6.16

	On 2009-05-04 Better hal support, several smaller fixes,
	improved polling loop for reduced power consumption
	and building/packaging fixes to make packaging easier
	were included in the new OpenCT release 0.6.16.


h3. Improved Security Updates and new OpenSC and Pam_P11

	On 2008-08-27 The Security Advisory was updated and OpenSC
	0.11.6 was released with a security relevant fix.
	Pam_p11 was updated to 0.1.5 with fixed documentation
	(wiki to html export).


h3. SCB obsolete, new windows binaries

	On 2008-08-01 New windows binary packages version 001 were made
	public. These new packages were build using MinGW setup. The
	old SCB installer package for windows is now obsolete, as there
	is noone left to maintain it.


h3. Security Updates and new versions

	On 2008-07-31 A security update was found and a security Advisory was
	released. Also OpenCT 0.6.15, OpenSC 0.11.5, Libp11 0.2.4,
	Pam_P11 0.1.4 and Engine_Pkcs11 0.1.5 were released.


h3. Smart Card Bundle 0.10

	On 2007-09-11 SCB 0.10 was released with OpenSC updated to 0.11.4.


h3. OpenSC 0.11.4

	On 2007-09-10 OpenSC 0.11.4 was released with some support for CardOS M4 cards initialized with siemens software, and with the new AKIS driver.

	On 2007-08-23 OpenCT 0.6.13 was released with hotplug improvements


h3. OpenCT 0.6.12

	On 2007-07-11 OpenCT 0.6.12 with many improvents and merging the rfid support.


h3. OpenSC 0.11.2

	On 2007-05-04 OpenSC 0.11.2 was released, with bugfixes, a free
	pkcs11.h header file, muscle support (in testing) and updated
	card drivers.


h3. pkcs11-helper 1.02

	On 2007-01-05 pkcs11-helper 1.02 was released, first standalone
	library for developers who wish to use PKCS#11 in their applications,
	but found it to be too complex.


h3. OpenCT 0.6.11

	On 2006-11-22 OpenCT 0.6.11 was released fixing non linux compiles.


h3. OpenCT 0.6.10

	On 2006-11-11 OpenCT 0.6.10 was released with minor bugfixes only.


h3. OpenCT 0.6.9

	On 2006-09-20 OpenCT 0.6.9 was released, the biggest change was
	moving to udev instead of hotplug for usb hotplug support.


h3. OpenCT 0.6.8

	On 2006-06-19 OpenCT 0.6.8 was released, fixing only a single
	small, but very annoing bug that caused spurious failures. Now
	openct works well, e.g. 1000 remote ssh logins in a row work
	without any failure.


h3. LinuxTag 2006


	From 2006 May 3rd to 6st we had a booth at
	"LinuxTag":http://www.linuxtag.org
	(in Wiesbaden, Germany). It was a big success with many
	people interested in using smart cards with OpenSC and
	friends. Some pictures of "building the booth":http://www.opensc-project.org/pictures/linuxtag2006/01building.jpg,
