h1. Trac Permissions

[[TracGuideToc]]

Trac uses a simple, case sensitive, permission system to control what users can and can't access.

Permission privileges are managed using the [TracAdmin trac-admin] tool or (new in version 0.11) the <i>General / Permissions</i> panel in the <i>Admin</i> tab of the web interface.

In addition to the default permission policy described in this page, it is possible to activate additional permission policies by enabling plugins and listing them in the `[trac] permission_policies` configuration entry in the TracIni. See TracFineGrainedPermissions for more details.

Non-authenticated users accessing the system are assigned the name "anonymous". Assign permissions to the "anonymous" user to set privileges for anonymous/guest users. The parts of Trac that a user does not have the privileges for will not be displayed in the navigation.
In addition to these privileges, users can be granted additional individual rights in effect when authenticated and logged into the system. All logged in users belong to the virtual group "authenticated", which inherits permissions from "anonymous".

h2. Graphical Admin Tab

<i>This feature is new in version 0.11.</i>

To access this tab, a user must have `TRAC_ADMIN privileges`. This can be performed as follows (more on the trac-admin script below):
<pre><code>  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add bob TRAC_ADMIN
</code></pre>

Then, the user `bob` will be able to see the Admin tab, and can then access the permissions menu. This menu will allow you to perform all the following actions, but from the browser without requiring root access to the server (just the correct permissions for your user account).

An easy way to quickly secure a new Trac install is to run the above command on the anonymous user, install the "AccountManagerPlugin":http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/AccountManagerPlugin, create a new admin account graphically and then remove the TRAC_ADMIN permission from the anonymous user.

h2. Available Privileges

To enable all privileges for a user, use the `TRAC_ADMIN` permission. Having `TRAC_ADMIN` is like being `root` on a *NIX system: it will allow you to perform any operation.

Otherwise, individual privileges can be assigned to users for the various different functional areas of Trac (<b>note that the privilege names are case-sensitive</b>):

h2. Granting Privileges

You grant privileges to users using [[trac-admin|TracAdmin]]. The current set of privileges can be listed with the following command:
<pre><code>  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission list
</code></pre>

This command will allow the user <i>bob</i> to delete reports:
<pre><code>  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add bob REPORT_DELETE
</code></pre>

The `permission add` command also accepts multiple privilege names:
<pre><code>  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add bob REPORT_DELETE WIKI_CREATE
</code></pre>

Or add all privileges:
<pre><code>  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add bob TRAC_ADMIN
</code></pre>

h2. Permission Groups

There are two built-in groups, "authenticated" and "anonymous".
Any user who has not logged in is automatically in the "anonymous" group.
Any user who has logged in is also in the "authenticated" group.
The "authenticated" group inherits permissions from the "anonymous" group.
For example, if the "anonymous" group has permission WIKI_MODIFY, 
it is not necessary to add the WIKI_MODIFY permission to the "authenticated" group as well.

Custom groups may be defined that inherit permissions from the two built-in groups.

Permissions can be grouped together to form roles such as <i>developer</i>, <i>admin</i>, etc.
<pre><code>  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add developer WIKI_ADMIN
  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add developer REPORT_ADMIN
  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add developer TICKET_MODIFY
  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add bob developer
  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add john developer
</code></pre>

Group membership can be checked by doing a _permission list_ with no further arguments; the resulting output will include group memberships. <b>Use at least one lowercase character in group names, as all-uppercase names are reserved for permissions</b>.

h2. Adding a New Group and Permissions

Permission groups can be created by assigning a user to a group you wish to create, then assign permissions to that group.

The following will add <i>bob</i> to the new group called <i>beta_testers</i> and then will assign WIKI_ADMIN permissions to that group. (Thus, <i>bob</i> will inherit the WIKI_ADMIN permission)
<pre><code>    $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add bob beta_testers
   $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission add beta_testers WIKI_ADMIN

</code></pre>

h2. Removing Permissions

Permissions can be removed using the 'remove' command. For example:

This command will prevent the user <i>bob</i> from deleting reports:
<pre><code>  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission remove bob REPORT_DELETE
</code></pre>

Just like `permission add`, this command accepts multiple privilege names.

You can also remove all privileges for a specific user:
<pre><code>  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission remove bob '*'
</code></pre>

Or one privilege for all users:
<pre><code>  $ trac-admin /path/to/projenv permission remove '*' REPORT_ADMIN
</code></pre>

h2. Default Permissions

By default on a new Trac installation, the `anonymous` user will have <i>view</i> access to everything in Trac, but will not be able to create or modify anything.
On the other hand, the `authenticated` users will have the permissions to <i>create and modify tickets and wiki pages</i>.
