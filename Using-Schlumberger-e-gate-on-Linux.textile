h1. Using Schlumberger e-gate on Linux

You have two options: PC/SC or OpenCT. 

 * PC/SC @ "http://dl.central.org/dl/software/ifd-egate/":http://dl.central.org/dl/software/ifd-egate/

h2. Using OpenCT as a PC/SC reader

TODO: This should be moved to [openct:WikiStart OpenCT Wiki]
<pre><code>cat > /etc/reader.conf.d/openct <<EOF
FRIENDLYNAME    OpenCT
DEVICENAME      /dev/null
LIBPATH         /usr/lib/openct-ifd.so
CHANNELID       0
EOF
update-reader.conf
/etc/init.d/pcscd restart
opensc-tool -l
opensc-tool -a -r 0
</code></pre>

/etc/reader.conf.d/ feature is available on debian/ubuntu and on fedora as far as I know, users of other distributions will want
to edit (NOT OVERWRITE) /etc/reader.conf directly. Also only debian/ubuntu users need to run update-reader.conf command.
opensc-tool -l should show the OpenCT reader via pcsc, and be able to read the atr from it.
