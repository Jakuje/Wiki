<b> Decryption with RSA key 1024 bits </b>

Its seems that decryption with the imported RSA key of 1024 bits length is not working.[[BR]]
This is using the OpenSC middleware, as well as the IAS/ECC Middleware v2.0.13 from ANTS (supplied by Gemalto) .

The test consisted in:
 - add PKCS#11 module from the ANTS middleware to the list of security modules in Firefox;
 - import some encryption PKCS#12 into the 'ECC eID' token;
 - in Thunderbird send encrypted mail;
 - try to decrypt.

'PSO_DECRYPT' apdu returns error <i>condition of use not satisfied</i>.
