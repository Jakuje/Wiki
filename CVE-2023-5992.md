CVE-2023-5992: Marvin: Side-channel leaks while stripping encryption PKCS#1.5 padding in OpenSC
===============================================================================================

The OpenSC code handling the PKCS#1.5 encryption padding removal is not implemented in side-channel
resistant way, which can lead to decryption of previously captured RSA ciphertexts and forging of
signatures.

The code is executed in the common case, where the smart cards implement only raw RSA key operation
and the de-padding in decryption case is handled by the OpenSC code.

Affected versions: all before 0.24.0

Fixed with TODO
