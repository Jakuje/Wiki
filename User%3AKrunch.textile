I enjoy playing with Unix systems, breaking things, fixing things, reading code and tinkering with low level components and tools (kernel, libc, debuggers,...). I wrote small patches to fix or improve tools I use like arping, strace or "SystemTap":http://sourceware.org/systemtap/. I co-founded the "Free Software Users Group Arlon (Belgium)":http://fsugar.be/ where technical talks and social meetings are organised frequently. As of January 2011, I am currently unemployed and using my free time to toy with ideas like the one described in my "FOSDEM 2011":wiki/OpenSC-@-FOSDEM-2011 talk.
