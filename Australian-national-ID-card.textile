h1. Australian national ID card

"Sydney Morning Herald":http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/official-national-card-due-by-2010/2006/04/26/1145861419456.html reports there
will be a national card in australia containing a smart card by 2010. See also the "discussion on slashdot":http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/04/27/0240203.

We don't know anything about it so far, but of course we want OpenSC to support that card. If you know how we can get a demo card or a spec,
please contact us.
