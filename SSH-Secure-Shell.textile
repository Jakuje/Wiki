h1. SSH Secure Shell 


h2. Windows (Putty)

"putty.exe":https://github.com/NoMoreFood/putty-cac/releases from "Putty-CAC":http://www.risacher.org/putty-cac/, an improved version of "Putty-SC":http://www.joebar.ch/puttysc/ adds PKCS#11 support to putty, which the upstream version does not have. It works flawlessly with OpenSC PKCS#11 module. A fork of Putty, named " KiTTY":http://www.9bis.net/kitty/ also exists.
Using the "pageant.exe":https://github.com/NoMoreFood/putty-cac/releases from Putty-CAC allows to use "WinSCP":http://winscp.net/eng/index.php with smart cards as well.

h2. Linux / Mac OS X (OpenSSH)

See [[OpenSSH-and-smart-cards-PKCS#11]] for more information.

h2. PuttyCard (deprecated)

[[PuTTYcard|PuTTYcard]] is another, independent implementation to add smart card support to putty.
Read more about it [[here|PuTTYcard]], and download the files from "opensc-project.org contrib":http://www.opensc-project.org/files/contrib/ directory.
