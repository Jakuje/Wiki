h1. Getting started with OpenSC

First you need to "obtain and install":wiki/Compiling-and-Installing-OpenSC-on-Unix-flavors OpenSC software. If the card you want to use is listed as a read-only card in the "SupportedHardware":wiki/Supported-hardware-(smart-cards-and-USB-tokens) list then you can skip the [wiki:CardPersonalization CardPersonalization] with pkcs15-init.

Eventually you will want to use your smart card with various applications. See <b>ApplicationSupport</b> for an incomplete list of supported applications.

<b>SecurityConsiderations</b> must be taken into account when using OpenSC.

If you get stuck with OpenSC and don't find the answer from "FrequentlyAskedQuestions":wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions, ask for help on "opensc-user mailing list":wiki/Mailing-lists. If you think you have found a bug then please [/newticket report it] but remember - bug tracker is not a support forum. Use the mailing list if you are not sure.
