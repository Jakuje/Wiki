h1. OpenSSL engine for PKCS#11 modules

_engine_pkcs11_ is an implementation of "OpenSSL":http://www.openssl.org/ "engine interface":http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/engine.html. It can be loaded
using code, config file or command line and will pass some OpenSSL functions to a PKCS#11 module.
_engine_pkcs11_ is meant to be used with PKCS#11 hardware drivers, such as OpenSC. Currently only RSA with PKCS#1 padding (CKM_RSA_PKCS) is supported ([[GetInvolved|Getting-involved-in-OpenSC-development]] and improve it!).

OpenSC is written by an international team and is licensed as Open Source software under the new BSD license. For a list of all authors and contributors as well as detailed license information see [[Authors-and-License|Authors-and-License]].

Engine_pkcs11 is based on the [[libp11 library|libp11-PKCS#11-wrapper-library]].
