h2. OpenSC - tools and libraries for smart cards

OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to work with smart cards. Its main focus is on cards that support cryptographic operations, and facilitate their use in security applications such as authentication, mail encryption and digital signatures. OpenSC implements the <b>"PKCS#11 API":http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2133</b> so applications supporting this API (such as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird) can use it. On the card OpenSC implements the "PKCS#15":http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2141 standard and aims to be compatible with every software/card that does so, too. 

OpenSC is written by an international team of volunteers and is licensed as "Open Source":http://www.opensource.org/ software under the  "LGPL license":http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

Before you  [[<b>GetStarted</b>|Getting-started-with-OpenSC]] with using OpenSC be sure to check the [[<b>SupportedHardware</b>|Supported-hardware-(smart-cards-and-USB-tokens)]] list as typical smart cards are incompatible with all other smart cards and come with no public documentation.

[[<b>DeveloperInformation</b>|Creating-applications-with-smart-card-support]] is available for those who want to build smart card capable applications. Developers who want to [[<b>GetInvolved</b>|Getting-involved-in-OpenSC-development]] with OpenSC are needed as well.

h2. Sub-projects

OpenSC effort consists of various sub-projects that can be used independently as well, without OpenSC:
 * [[engine_pkcs11|OpenSSL-engine-for-PKCS#11-modules]] is an OpenSSL engine to use PKCS#11 providers, either from command line or from applications
 * [[libp11|libp11-PKCS#11-wrapper-library]] is a small C wrapper library for working with PKCS#11 modules.
 * [[pkcs11-helper|pkcs11-helper]] eases working with PKCS#11 modules, by implementing common tasks.
 * "PAM-PKCS#11":https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/wiki implements various authentication methods
 * [[pam_p11|pam_p11-simple-RSA-authentication-with-PKCS#11-modules]] is a small and simple PAM module for local authentication
 * [[OpenCT|https://github.com/OpenSC/openct/wiki]] implements a reader driver interface for various non-standard readers on Linux, meant to be used with OpenSC.
 * [[OpenSC-Java|Using-smart-cards-with-Java-SE]] is a Java<->OpenSC bridge?
